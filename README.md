# StockSight-DSA-Project
For my Data Structures and Algorithms' final project, we developed an application that uses graphs and animations to analyze financial data from different big stock market companies. For faster search queries based on time ranges, we used segment trees which was on the core of our back end for this project.

## Overview
StockSight is a stock market analysis system that leverages **segment trees** to efficiently store and retrieve financial data based on specific time range queries. The system processes stock market data from financial APIs, enabling users to analyze trends, compute key metrics, and visualize financial insights effectively.

## Key Features
- **Segment Trees for Efficient Queries**: Optimized search and retrieval of stock data within specific time ranges.
- **Financial Data Processing**: Fetches and processes data such as:
  - Stock prices
  - Trading volumes
  - Timestamps
  - Company information
  - Historical data
- **Stock Market Metrics Computation**:
  - Moving Averages
  - Volatility
  - Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Other statistical insights
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Graphs
  - Tables
  - Additional visual representations based on computed metrics
- **User Interface with Filtering**: Users can apply multiple filters to refine stock data.
- **Potential Additional Features**:
  - **Real-Time Stock Data Analyzer**: Alerts users on sudden changes in stock market metrics.
  - **Stock Market Prediction Model**: Forecasts future trends based on historical data.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Structure**: Segment Trees
- **APIs**: Financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or others)
- **Frontend**: Graphs and tables for visualization
- **Backend**: Efficient storage and query processing with segment trees
